"""A community mod's modified game files, turned into a port mod.

The mods of the PS1 scene (Mod 13, FM 2023, Shin...) ship patched copies of
SLUS_014.11 and WA_MRG.MRG, or a patched disc. This compares them with the
player's retail files and writes what differs in the port's terms:

* cards, fusions, equips, rituals, deck and drop pools: the editor's own
  diff (manifest.build), so the result opens in the editor like any mod;
* other text (dialogue, menus, types, duelists, places): a partial text
  listing (text_listing.py's format), "text" in mod.json;
* other changed bytes of WA_MRG.MRG (images, passwords and costs, starter
  decks...): "data" patches, or sector replacements for long runs; the port
  reads WA_MRG.MRG through its override layer, so they apply;
* what the port cannot take from a data file (code and tables in the
  executable, such as the AI's parameters or the field bonuses; other disc
  files) is listed in the report instead.
