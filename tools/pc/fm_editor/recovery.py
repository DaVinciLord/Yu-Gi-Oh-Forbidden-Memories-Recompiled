"""Separate JSON recovery copies and rotating backups of saved mod folders.

A copy hard-links each file unchanged since the previous copy (same size and
time, and settled before that copy was made) instead of copying it again, so
a large mod's art costs its disk space once and an autosave takes no time.
Copies are never written into after they are made, so sharing is safe.

The editor takes what a copy needs from the project on its own thread
(Recovery.prepare: the undo history's snapshot, a few names) and writes it
on another (Writer), so a big mod's copy does not stop the window."""
