/* The control channel's text protocol (control.h, notes/agent-control.md):
 * one command a line, one reply line a command ("ok ..." or "err ...").
 * Only parsing and framing here, with nothing of the game or of sockets, so
 * that CTest checks it on its own (tests/pc/control_protocol_test.c).
 *
 *     step N            run N VBlanks (decimal), stop at the next safe point
 *     pad P BITS        hold pad P's (1 or 2) active-high bits (hex) from now on
 *     shot PATH         the presented picture as PNG (PPM when PATH ends in .ppm)
 *     hash              FNV-1a of all of VRAM, as MEMORIES_FRAME_HASHES writes it
 *     peek ADDR LEN     LEN bytes (decimal) of guest memory at ADDR (hex)
 *     poke ADDR HEX     write the bytes HEX spells at ADDR (hex)
 *     save PATH         a save state
 *     load PATH         resume a save state
 *     info              frame, VBlank, mode, build id
 *     quit              end the game
 *
 * Numbers that are hex may carry a 0x; decimal ones may be given as 0x...
 * too. A path is the rest of the line, spaces included. */
