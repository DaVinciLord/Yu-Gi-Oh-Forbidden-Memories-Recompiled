/* View > Free Duel progress: the counting (free_duel_progress.h). The screen
 * and the drawing are in free_duel_progress_view.c.
 *
 * The drop pools come off the disc as the yamyi-mods Library panel reads
 * them: WA_MRG 0xE9B000 + 0x1800 * (id - 1), three sectors an opponent,
 * four 1460-byte rows of 722 halfword weights (deck, S/A-POW, B/C/D,
 * S/A-TEC) and the rank table. Only the three drop rows count; the deck
 * pool is what an opponent plays with, not what it gives away. Each row
 * then goes through Tables_PoolFor, the call the game's own drop roll
 * makes, so what the player sees is what a duel would roll.
 *
 * Both are fixed for a session: the disc's files (and the data mods that
 * replace them) are put in place at startup, and so are the mods' tables
 * (Tables_Build). The rows are read once and each opponent's cards are
 * worked out once, the first time the cursor rests on it; only the owned
 * half is counted again, since the trunk changes. */
