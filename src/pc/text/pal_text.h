/* The official European languages (Game > Language, language.h): the text of
 * a PAL disc's language pack turned into a listing with the US string ids,
 * which translation.c compiles as it does a mod's (notes/translation.md,
 * "The official languages"). Pure: the caller reads the disc.
 *
 * A PAL disc keeps its text in DATA/WA_MRG.MRG, one pack per language
 * (English, French, German, Italian, Spanish), and in each pack three files,
 * every one a u16 id (0x0F, 0x10, 0x11 + 3 per language) and a u16 0, then:
 *   A (0xF000 bytes): a u16 table at +4, offsets from the file's start, of
 *      the menus (0x000-0x0FF), the card texts (0x100-0x3FF) and, into file
 *      B, the story's lines (0x400-0x4F9); then the menus and card texts
 *   B (0x10000): the story's lines
 *   C (0x7180): the names, a u16 table at +4 (0x360 of them), offsets from
 *      0x5800 before the file's start, as the US names bank's
 * The codes are the US text's but for three: F8 1B, with no operand, is the
 * player's name; the name buffers sit at A+0xF800/F814/F848; and F8 03's
 * numbers are 0x15D7C lower in RAM. The glyph codes are the PAL
 * executable's (a Shift-JIS table at 0x801D9000, 0x400 bytes), with the
 * accented letters on placeholder codes each language's font draws its own
 * way (the tables in pal_text.c). */
