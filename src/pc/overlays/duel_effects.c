 * The decomp matched the whole North American bank, and its C
 * (src/overlays/duel_effects) is linked in: that runs whenever the bytes the
 * disc delivered are the retail bank (src/pc/guest/retail_image.c). A mod or
 * disc patch that changed any of them gets the delivered MIPS run by the
 * interpreter instead, which bridges its resident SDK and game calls to the
 * native port. MEMORIES_TRACE=mods reports which of the two each delivery
 * got.
 *
 * MEMORIES_DUEL_EFFECTS=interpreter interprets the bank even when it is
 * retail (the reference for comparing the two). MEMORIES_DUEL_EFFECTS=skip
 * restores the bring-up behaviour (it was called `native` before the bank
 * ran as native C; `native` now means the default): fusion (1), battle
 * damage (2) and destruction (3) interpreted, everything else reported
 * complete on its first update. An effect the interpreter cannot run is
 * reported once and completed the same way from then on. */
