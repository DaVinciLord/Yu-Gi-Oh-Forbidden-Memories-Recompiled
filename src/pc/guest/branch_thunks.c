/* Indirect calls and jumps that may land in guest code, without DEP.
 *
 * Tables in the retail data image hold MIPS function addresses (the text
 * opcode handlers, callbacks an overlay installs), and native code calls
 * through them. Every unit the build compiles sends its indirect calls and
 * jumps through the thunks below: clang's -mretpoline-external-thunk and
 * GCC's -mindirect-branch=thunk-extern -mindirect-branch-register load the
 * target into a register and call or jump to __x86_indirect_thunk_<register>
 * (tools/pc/build_game32.py, tools/pc/build_mod.py). A target in guest memory
 * goes to Memories_GuestBranchResolver (image.c: the native function of that
 * address, or the MIPS interpreter's entry for an overlay callback), anything
 * else is jumped to as it is. A module function that C calls by name is
 * pinned to its guest address, so that call is direct and no thunk sees it:
 * the build gives each such name a host stub that pushes the address and
 * enters Memories_GuestBranchDirect below, which resolves it the same way.
 *
 * Before these, the only way in was the fault of executing guest RAM, which
 * needs DEP for the process: with DEP off, the MIPS bytes of a handler ran as
 * x86 code (the title's Options: the text handler at 0x80038b4c jumped to
 * 0x902b4950). The fault handler in image.c stays as the second net.
 *
 * The contract, for the compilers' code and for mods built by build_mod.py:
 * every register is kept, the target register too (a compiler may pick a
 * callee-saved one and keep it across the call), and the stack is as it was,
 * the caller's return address on top for a call, so a native function or
 * Memories_MipsThunk starts exactly as it would from a direct call (or from
 * the fault handler's redirect). Flags are not kept: they are dead at an
 * indirect call or jump. Nothing is stored below the stack pointer, where the
 * Windows interrupt clock pushes while the thread is suspended.
 *
 * Fast path: one test. Bits 21-28 and 30 are clear in every guest range
 * (physical 0x10000..0x200000, 0x80000000..0x80200000, 0xA0000000..
 * 0xA0200000); executable code never has them all clear, and the few host
 * addresses that do (0x20000000..0x20200000) come back from the resolver
 * unchanged. Slow path: a copy of the return address becomes the slot the
 * final `ret` takes the destination from (and what a stack walk reads as
 * the frame's return address), eax/ecx/edx/flags are saved, the resolver is
 * called on a 16-byte aligned stack, and everything is restored. */
